# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Overview

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a fully managed container orchestration service offered by Microsoft Azure. It streamlines the process of deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes. AKS removes the complexities of manual setup and configuration of Kubernetes clusters, allowing developers to concentrate on application development and deployment.

## Key Features

- **Simplified Cluster Management:** AKS automates the creation and management of Kubernetes clusters, handling the setup of infrastructure, master components, and worker nodes.
- **Scalability and Availability:** Built-in scaling capabilities in AKS enable easy adjustment of application scale based on demand. It also supports availability zones for enhanced resiliency.
- **Integrated Developer Tools:** AKS seamlessly integrates with various Azure services and developer tools, such as Azure DevOps, Azure Container Registry, and Visual Studio Code, streamlining development and deployment workflows.
- **Security and Compliance:** AKS offers robust security features, including integration with Azure Active Directory, role-based access control (RBAC), and network security policies, ensuring secure access and protection for containerized applications.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up AKS, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- An active Azure subscription for creating and managing AKS clusters.
- The Azure CLI installed on your local machine to interact with AKS via the command line.
- kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool, installed to manage AKS clusters effectively.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and manage an AKS cluster:

1. **Create an AKS Cluster:** Learn how to establish an AKS cluster using either the Azure CLI or Azure portal.
2. **Deploy Containerized Applications:** Explore different deployment methods, such as using YAML manifests or Helm charts, to deploy applications to your AKS cluster.
3. **Cluster Management:** Discover how to scale your cluster, manage node pools, monitor resources, and perform upgrades and maintenance tasks.
4. **Azure DevOps Integration:** Integrate AKS with Azure DevOps for automated CI/CD pipelines, source code management, and continuous deployment.
5. **Security and Advanced Features:** Learn about securing your AKS cluster with network policies, Azure Private Link, and Azure Active Directory integration.
