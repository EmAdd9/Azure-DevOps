# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Integration with Azure DevOps

This documentation offers guidance on seamlessly integrating Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Azure DevOps, facilitating the deployment and management of containerized applications. Here's a comprehensive guide to utilizing AKS within Azure DevOps, covering the establishment of CI/CD pipelines, deployment to AKS, and AKS cluster management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- An active Azure subscription.
- Azure DevOps organization and project set up.
- Provisioned Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Creating an AKS Cluster

If you haven't already set up an AKS cluster, follow the steps outlined in the Azure AKS documentation to create and configure your cluster. Take note of key cluster details such as the resource group, cluster name, and connection information, as these will be required for subsequent steps.

## Setting Up Azure DevOps Project

To integrate AKS with Azure DevOps, the setup of an Azure DevOps project and configuration of necessary settings are required. Here's how to initiate the process:

1. **Create a New Azure DevOps Project:** Follow the instructions in the Azure DevOps documentation to establish a new project.
2. **Configure Project Settings:** Customize project settings including repositories, work items, and pipelines to align with your project's requirements.

## Creating CI/CD Pipelines

Azure DevOps provides a robust suite of capabilities for creating CI/CD pipelines that automate build, test, and deployment processes. Follow these steps to create CI/CD pipelines for your AKS project:

1. **Create a Pipeline:** Learn how to craft a pipeline in Azure DevOps that defines the build and release procedures for your application.
2. **Configure Pipeline Triggers:** Explore various triggers and scheduling options to automate pipeline runs based on code changes or specific time intervals.
3. **Build Docker Images:** Configure the pipeline to build Docker images for your application, ready for deployment to AKS.
4. **Publish Docker Images:** Set up the pipeline to publish the generated Docker images to Azure Container Registry or another chosen container registry.
5. **Deploy to AKS:** Define the deployment steps within your pipeline to effectively deploy the application to AKS, leveraging Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts.
6. **Configure Environment Variables:** Securely manage and utilize environment variables within your pipeline for storing sensitive information such as AKS credentials.

## Deploying to AKS

Once your CI/CD pipelines are established, deploying applications to AKS becomes straightforward. Follow these steps:

1. Push your code changes to the designated repository within Azure DevOps.
2. Observe the pipeline initiating and automatically executing build and release processes.
3. Verify the successful deployment of your application to AKS by monitoring specified release stages and environments.

## Managing AKS Clusters

Azure DevOps also offers capabilities for directly managing AKS clusters from the platform. Learn how to:

- **Scale AKS Cluster:** Adjust the number of nodes within your AKS cluster to align with application demands.
- **Upgrade AKS Cluster:** Perform cluster upgrades to leverage new features and bug fixes provided by Azure.
- **Monitor AKS Cluster:** Utilize Azure DevOps monitoring tools to monitor the health, performance, and resource utilization of your AKS cluster.
