# Setting up an Azure DevOps Organization

To set up an Azure DevOps organization, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Free Azure Account:** If you don't already have an Azure account, you can sign up for a free account at [Microsoft-Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

2. **Access Azure DevOps in the Azure Portal:** Once you have your Azure account, go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com). Sign in with your Azure account credentials.

3. **Search for Azure DevOps:** In the Azure portal, use the search bar at the top to search for "Azure DevOps." You should see the Azure DevOps Organization option in the search results. Click on it to open the Azure DevOps page.

4. **Create a New Organization:** On the Azure DevOps page, click on "Create a new organization." Provide the necessary details for your organization, such as the organization name and the Azure Active Directory (AAD) organization ID.

5. **Access Your Organization:** Once your organization is created, you can access it by navigating to `dev.azure.com/org-name`, where "org-name" should be replaced with your actual organization name.

From there, you can start using Azure DevOps and explore its various features and services, such as Azure Boards, Azure Repos, Azure Pipelines, Azure Test Plans, and Azure Artifacts. The [Microsoft Docs documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops) mentioned earlier provides detailed guidance on how to work with each of these features within your Azure DevOps organization.

Remember that you will have access to certain free services and limitations within your Azure DevOps organization, and depending on your needs, you can choose to upgrade to paid plans for additional features and capacity.

# Azure DevOps Documentation

The official documentation for Azure DevOps can be found on the [Microsoft Docs website](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops). Here, you will find a wealth of resources, including tutorials, guides, and reference documentation covering various aspects of Azure DevOps. The documentation is organized into different sections, allowing you to explore topics such as:

1. **Azure Boards:** This section covers features related to project planning, tracking, and collaboration, such as creating work items, managing backlogs, and configuring boards.

2. **Azure Repos:** Here, you'll find information about version control using Git or Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC). The documentation covers topics like branching, merging, and setting up repositories.

3. **Azure Pipelines:** This section focuses on continuous integration, continuous delivery, and release management. It provides details on configuring build pipelines, automating testing, and deploying applications to various platforms.

4. **Azure Test Plans:** In this section, you can learn about creating and managing test plans, executing manual and automated tests, and tracking test results.

5. **Azure Artifacts:** Here, you'll find information on package management, including creating and publishing packages, as well as integrating with other package managers like npm and NuGet.

6. **Azure DevOps CLI:** This section covers the Azure DevOps command-line interface (CLI), which allows you to automate tasks and interact with Azure DevOps from the command line.

Additionally, the documentation provides guidance on integrating Azure DevOps with other Azure services, configuring security and permissions, and using extensions and marketplace offerings to extend the functionality of Azure DevOps.

Remember that the Azure DevOps documentation is regularly updated, so it's always a good idea to check for the latest information and best practices when working with the platform.
